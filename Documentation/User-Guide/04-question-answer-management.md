   - Appears on answer cards
   - May show a number (e.g., "2 triggered questions")

3. Search for questions to trigger
4. Select and confirm

### Removing Triggered Questions

   - Click the "Ã—" or delete button

2. **Confirm Deletion**
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - Click **"Delete"** to remove relationship

## Best Practices

### Question Writing

**Be Clear and Concise**
- Use simple language
- Avoid medical jargon unless appropriate for audience
- Example: "Do you have diabetes?" vs. "Have you been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus?"

**One Question, One Concept**
- Don't combine multiple questions
- Bad: "Do you smoke or drink alcohol?"
- Good: Two separate questions for smoking and alcohol

**Use Appropriate Question Types**
- Single Select: When only one answer is valid
- Multiselect: When multiple answers apply
- Free Text: When you need detailed, open-ended responses
- Numeric: When collecting measurements or counts
- Date: When timing is important

---

### Answer Writing

**Provide Complete Options**
- Include all reasonable choices
- Add "Other (please specify)" with text input for unlisted options
- Include "Prefer not to answer" or "Unknown" when appropriate

**Use Parallel Structure**
- Keep answer formats consistent
- Example: "Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly", "Yearly" (not "Every day", "Once a week", etc.)

**Order Answers Logically**
- Chronological: "Never", "Former", "Current"
- Numerical: "0-5", "6-10", "11-15", "16+"
- Alphabetical: For long lists of items
- Most to least common: For symptom lists

---

### Voice Selection

**Case Manager Voice**
- Questions the care coordinator asks
- Administrative or assessment questions
- Example: "What is the patient's primary language?"

**Patient Voice**
- Questions answered by the patient
- Personal experience and symptoms
- Example: "How would you rate your pain level?"

**Caregiver Voice**
- Questions directed to family or caregivers
- Observations about the patient
- Example: "Have you noticed changes in memory or behavior?"

---

### Secondary Inputs

**When to Use Text Input**
- "Other" options: "Other (please specify)"
- Additional details: "If yes, please describe"

**When to Use Date Input**
- Timing of events: "If yes, when did this occur?"
- Historical dates: "Date of diagnosis"

**When to Use Numeric Input**
- Counts: "How many medications?"
- Measurements: "Weight in pounds"
- Ratings: "On a scale of 1-10"

---

### Mutually Exclusive Answers

**Use for:**
- "None of the above" in multiselect lists
- "Not applicable" options
- "Decline to answer" choices

**Don't use for:**
- Regular answer options
- Answers that can logically coexist with others
